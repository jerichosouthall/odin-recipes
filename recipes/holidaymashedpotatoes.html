        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These mashed potatoes are too fattening to have on a regular basis. I only make these on holidays, and everyone wonders what's in them that's makes them so rich...</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 pounds red potatoes, peeled and quartered<l/i>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until fork tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain, add butter, and mash using a potato masher, ricer or mixer.</li>
            <li>Gradually beat in the heavy cream. Serve hot!</li>
