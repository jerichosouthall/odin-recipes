# odin-recipes

<h2>What is this project about?</h2>

<p>"Recipes" is the project at the end of The Odin Project's HTML foundations curriculum.</p>

<p>In this project I showcased:

<ul> 

<li>Setting up an HTML document using the HTML boilerplate.
Using text in HTML (paragraphs, headers).</li>

<li>Using tags and elements.</li>

<li>Using unordered and ordered lists.</li>

<li>Adding images, links, and using multiple files.</li>

<li>My ability to use Git and commit messages.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Reflections</h2

<p>My commit messages could have been organized better, especially at the beginning. I need to get more comfortable amending commits. Overall, aside from the commits, I completed the project easily and completely. Looking ahead to what's next!</p>
