<p>Project can be seen at https://jerichosouthall.github.io/odin-recipes/.</p>

<h2>What is this project about?</h2>

<p>"Recipes" is the project at the end of The Odin Project's <em>HTML Foundations</em> curriculum.</p>

<p>In this project I showcased:

<ul> 

<li>Setting up an HTML document using the HTML boilerplate.
Using text in HTML in the form of paragraphs and headers.</li>

<li>Using tags and elements.</li>

<li>Using unordered and ordered lists.</li>

<li>Adding images, links, and using multiple files.</li>

<li>My ability to use Git and commit messages.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Reflections</h2

<p>My commit messages could have been organized better, especially at the beginning. I need to get more comfortable amending commits. Overall, aside from some discomfort with the initial commits, I completed the project easily and completely. Looking ahead to what's next!</p>
